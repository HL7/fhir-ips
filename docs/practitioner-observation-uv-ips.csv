However this cannot consistently be assured. and when the meaning is not guaranteed to be consistent, the version SHOULD be exchanged.","Where the terminology does not clearly define what string should be used to identify code system versions, the recommendation is to use the date (expressed in FHIR date format) on which that version was officially published as the version date.","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Coding.version",0,1,"ele-1
