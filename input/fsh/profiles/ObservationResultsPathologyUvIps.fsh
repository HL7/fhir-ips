* ^purpose = "This profile constrains the Observation resource to represent a pathology in vitro study. In case of a multiple-observation study, the results of the study appear as sub-observations. In this case this top-level Observation acts as a grouper of all the observations belonging to the study.  The top-level observation may carry a conclusion in the value element and or a global interpretation by the producer of the study, in the comment element."

In the latter case, the observation carries the overall conclusion of the study and references the atomic results of the study as \"has-member\" child observations"
