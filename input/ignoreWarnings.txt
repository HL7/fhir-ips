WARNING: Medication/eumfh-39-07-1: Medication.ingredient[0].strength.denominator: UCUM Codes that contain human readable annotations like {tablet} can be misleading (e.g. they are ignored when comparing units). Best Practice is not to depend on annotations in the UCUM code, so this usage should be checked
