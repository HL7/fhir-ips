# 01. EXAMPLES: Example bundles may reference external resources (e.g., a PDF of an Advance Directive) without embedding them directly. This reflects real-world practice and is intentional in these exampl
INFORMATION: Bundle/bundle-ips-all-sections: Bundle: Can't find 'https://fhir.example.com/DocumentReference/advance-directive-123/content' in the bundle (Bundle.entry[37].resource.content[0].attachment.url)

# 02. EXAMPLES: Identifiers such as HPI facility, NHI, and professional board IDs are valid in the New Zealand context. They are included as illustrative examples, even though the URIs are not registered in the HL7 build terminology service.

# 03. EXAMPLES: Several example resources use European-specific code systems identified by OIDs. These are included for realism in examples but are not supported by the HL7 build service.

# 04. EXAMPLES: Examples intentionally illustrate the use of local identifiers and custom extensions in Patient and Device resources. This demonstrates flexibility for implementers, even though these URIs are not defined in the build terminology service.
INFORMATION: Patient/eumfh-39-07: Patient.extension[0]: This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/StructureDefinition/Patient-uv-ips|2.0.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# 05. EXAMPLES: Previous IPS guides have included multilingual displays to demonstrate international applicability. These are retained for consistency, despite known limitations in the build service for validating language-specific display names.

# 06. EXAMPLES: The IPS specification directs implementers to use `effectiveDateTime` for MedicationStatement. Some examples use period to highlight some medications may not be for a specific date even though this generates profile slice messages.
%This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/StructureDefinition/MedicationStatement-uv-ips|2.0.0%

# 07. OBLIGATIONS: The obligation extension generates slice warnings, but these are expected. The extension is reused across many resources, leading to repeated validation messages that do not indicate an actual problem.
%This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/obligation%

# 08. TERMINOLOGY: Some ImagingStudy bindings (e.g., to RadLex and DICOM references) are inherited from base FHIR and cannot be overridden in IPS. Resulting warnings are acknowledged but not actionable within this guide.

%ValueSet 'http://www.rsna.org/RadLex_Playbook.aspx' not found%

# 09. TERMINOLOGY: R5 ActorDefinition points to a deprecated ValueSet, while the corresponding R6 ValueSet retains the required codes. This is a known transitional issue and is acceptable for IPS examples.
INFORMATION: ActorDefinition/Consumer: ActorDefinition.jurisdiction[0]: Reference to deprecated ValueSet http://hl7.org/fhir/5.0/ValueSet/jurisdiction|5.0.0
INFORMATION: ActorDefinition/Creator: ActorDefinition.jurisdiction[0]: Reference to deprecated ValueSet http://hl7.org/fhir/5.0/ValueSet/jurisdiction|5.0.0
INFORMATION: ActorDefinition/Server: ActorDefinition.jurisdiction[0]: Reference to deprecated ValueSet http://hl7.org/fhir/5.0/ValueSet/jurisdiction|5.0.0

# 10. TERMINOLOGY: Some resources reference draft code systems from FHIR R4 (e.g., DiagnosticReport.status, ImagingStudy.status). These are inherited from base FHIR definitions and cannot be altered in the IPS guide.
INFORMATION: DiagnosticReport/hemoglobin: DiagnosticReport.status: Reference to draft CodeSystem http://hl7.org/fhir/diagnostic-report-status|4.0.1
INFORMATION: ImagingStudy/TII-ImagingStudy-5-1: ImagingStudy.status: Reference to draft CodeSystem http://hl7.org/fhir/imagingstudy-status|4.0.1

# 11. TERMINOLOGY: Certain CDA OIDs are carried forward from prior IPS publications and are maintained in ART-DECOR. Their use here is consistent with historical precedent and does not require new definitions in this guide.
%No definition could be found for URL value 'http://art-decor.org/ns/oids/vs'%

# 12. TERMINOLOGY: IPS leverages large international terminologies. The build service truncates expansions, so only subsets are displayed. This does not affect the correctness of the value sets.
%The value set expansion is too large, and only a subset has been displayed%
