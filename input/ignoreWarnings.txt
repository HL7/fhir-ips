# The slicing rule is open.  The Procedure.code value in the example is for a known procedure and satisfies the Procedure.code element constraints, and is not expected to match the slice defined for absentOrUnknownProcedure.

#  The Condition-39-07-1.xml instance does successfully validate with the Condition-uv-ips profile, and the SNOMED CT code 54329005 |Acute myocardial infarction of anterior wall (disorder)| is a member of the core-problem-finding-situation-event-gps-uv-ips value set, so this instance should match the problemGPSCode slice.
