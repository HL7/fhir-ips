# These warnings are generated for the bindings in the FHIR core ImagingStudy resource, not the ImagingStudy-uv-ips profile.

WARNING: ImagingStudy/TII-ImagingStudy-5-1: ImagingStudy.series[0].modality: ValueSet http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part16/sect_CID_29.html not found by validator

# The following code systems are not supported by the build terminology service.
INFORMATION: Immunization/75680: Immunization.vaccineCode.coding[2]: Code System URI "urn:oid:1.3.182.4.11.22" is unknown so the code cannot be validated
INFORMATION: Condition/eumfh-39-07-1: Condition.code.coding[1]: Code System URI "http://id.who.int/icd11/mms" is unknown so the code cannot be validated

# The Immunization-75680.xml instance does successfully validate against the Immunization-uv-ips profile, and the SNOMED CT code 414005006 |Diphtheria + tetanus + pertussis + poliomyelitis vaccine (product)| is a member of the vaccines-gps-uv-ips value set, so this instance should match the vaccineGPSCode slice.
INFORMATION: Immunization/75680: Immunization.vaccineCode: This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/StructureDefinition/Immunization-uv-ips

#  The Condition-39-07-1.xml instance does successfully validate with the Condition-uv-ips profile, and the SNOMED CT code 54329005 |Acute myocardial infarction of anterior wall (disorder)| is a member of the core-problem-finding-situation-event-gps-uv-ips value set, so this instance should match the problemGPSCode slice.
INFORMATION: Condition/eumfh-39-07-1: Condition.code: This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/StructureDefinition/Condition-uv-ips

# The slicing rule is open.  The Procedure.code value in the example is for a known procedure and satisfies the Procedure.code element constraints, and is not expected to match the slice defined for absentOrUnknownProcedure.

# The Range-uv-ips and its parent SimpleQuantity-uv-ips data types are not declared as mustSupport for the Observation.value slices in the result ooservation profiles, and no explicit examples are provided.  These profiles are included in the IG so that if the Range data type is used, the use of UCUM units is specified.
WARNING: http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/StructureDefinition/Range-uv-ips: The Implementation Guide contains no examples for this data type profile
WARNING: http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/StructureDefinition/SimpleQuantity-uv-ips: The Implementation Guide contains no examples for this data type profile

# This warning will resolve once the tx.fhir.org terminology server is updated, which will provide support for the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) code system fragment.
WARNING: healthcare-professional-roles-uv-ips: Error from server: Unable to provide support for code system urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.2.9.6.2.7

# This warning persists even when the Jira spec file that is generated by the build is updated in the JIRA-Spec-Artifacts repository.  The spec file will be updated again for the final publication.
WARNING: The jira specification file appears to be out of date with the versions, artifacts and pages currently defined in the IG.  A proposed revised file to be reviewed and, if appropriate, submitted as a pull request against the XML folder in https://github.com/HL7/JIRA-Spec-Artifacts.
