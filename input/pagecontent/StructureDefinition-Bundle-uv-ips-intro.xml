	While this Bundle profile lists many resources which may be included in an IPS document, specific requirements, 
	expectations and obligations are described in the <a href="StructureDefinition-Composition-uv-ips.html">IPS 
	Composition</a> profile. Therefore the only entry obligation shown below is on the IPS Composition, which 
	must be the first entry as explained in the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/documents.html">FHIR Documents.</a>
