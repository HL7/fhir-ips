		In this version of the guide the Immunization section has been extended to also include, when relevant, the status of immunity to specific target diseases.<br/>
		The section has been renamed to ImmuneStatus (Immunization/Immune Status) to reflect this (a status of immunity to a disease is the intended and desired outcome of a vaccinaation).<br/>
		The capability to record a statement of immunity to a disease and the supporting data for that statement is provided by a profile on the Condition resource, using specific codes (pre-coordinated).<br/>
		The Condition resource is used to represent the immune status, as immunity is an ongoing state of the patient.  It is not simply an observation at a point in time, although those observations will often be associated with the condition and used to provide supporting evidence for it.<br/>
		This capability is especially relevant and needed at the present time for recording immunity to the COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.<br/>
		A code for representing a condition of immunity to COVID-19 has not yet been developed and made available in SNOMED CT, so at this time a FHIR code for this is included in the value set.<br/>
		Comments are welcome and implementers of this STU are encouraged to provide their feedback about these design choices.<br/>
		This proposed solution will be also subject to evaluation by the wider cross-SDO IPS community, in order to assure a complete alignment among the different IPS standards; it is therefore potentially subject to change.
