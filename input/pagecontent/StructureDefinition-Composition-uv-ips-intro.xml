		In this version of the guide the Immunization section has been extended to also include, when relevant, the status of immunity to specific target diseases.
		The section has been renamed to ImmuneStatus (Immunization/Immune Status) to reflect this (a status of immunity to a disease is the intended and desired outcome of a vaccinaation).
		The capability to record a statement of immunity to a disease and the supporting data for that statement is provided by a profile on the Condition resource, using specific codes (pre-coordinated).
		The Condition resource is used to represent the immune status, as immunity is an ongoing state of the patient.  It is not simply an observation at a point in time, although those observations will often be associated with the condition and used to provide supporting evidence for it.
		This capability is especially relevant and needed at the present time for recording immunity to the COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
		A code for representing a condition of immunity to COVID-19 has not yet been developed and made available in SNOMED CT, so at this time a FHIR code for this is included in the value set.
		Comments are welcome and implementers of this STU are encouraged to provide their feedback about these design choices.
