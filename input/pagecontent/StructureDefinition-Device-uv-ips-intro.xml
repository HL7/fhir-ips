	This profile follows the <a href="https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=487">
	HL7 Cross Paradigm Implementation Guide: UDI Pattern</a> guidelines for exchanging information about the use 
	and implantation of medical devices in patients. While a unique device identifier (UDI) is not required in 
	this profile, it consists of a unique numeric or alphanumeric code, which may be machine-readable. The UDI 
	generally consists of a mandatory Device Identifier (DI) and a conditional Production identifier (PI) 
	that identifies one or more of the five UDI-PI elements. The UDI and its components may be mapped using the 
	guidance in <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/device-mappings.html#udi">FHIR UDI Mapping</a>
