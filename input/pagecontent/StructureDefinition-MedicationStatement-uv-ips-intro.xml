		<b>medicationCodeableConcept vs. medicationReference</b>
		<p>In the previously balloted versions, medicationCodeableConcept was not allowed to represent
			medications. To better support implementations, both options (medicationCodeableConcept and
			medicationReference) are now allowed, recognizing that different jurisdictions may provide
			different guidance worldwide and that future FHIR releases introduce <a
				href="https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/references.html#CodeableReference">CodeableReference
			</a>
		</p>
		<p>STU implementers are encouraged to provide their feedback about this design choice.</p>
