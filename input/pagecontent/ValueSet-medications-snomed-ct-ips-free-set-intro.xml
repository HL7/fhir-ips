		<b>Medication codes in SNOMED IPS Freeset and IPS Terminology</b>
		<p>As of 2022, there are few medication product codes in the SNOMED IPS Freeset and SNOMED IPS Terminology releases. This value set is included in the FHIR IPS Implementation Guide since we expect the code set freely available to increase in the future.</p>
		<p>For the most recent codes available in the IPS Terminology, please see <a href="https://www.snomed.org/snomed-ct/Other-SNOMED-products/international-patient-summary-terminology">SNOMED IPS Terminology</a></p>
