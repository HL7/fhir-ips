If a value is present, the datatype for this element should be determined by Observation.code. A CodeableConcept with just a text would be used instead of a string if the field was usually coded, or if the type associated with the Observation.code defines a coded value.

","Why the component result is missing","Provides a reason why the expected value in the element Observation.value[x] is missing.","""Null"" or exceptional values can be represented two ways in FHIR Observations.  One way is to simply include them in the value set and represent the exceptions in the value.  For example, measurement values for a serology test could be  ""detected"", ""not detected"", ""inconclusive"", or  ""test not done"".   The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.  For example, the dataAbsentReason code ""error"" could be used when the measurement was not completed.  Because of these options, use-case agreements are required to interpret general observations for exceptional values.","For many results it is necessary to handle exceptional values in measurements.","","","","","","","",,"extensible","Codes specifying why the result (Observation.value[x]) is missing.","http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/observation-valueabsentreason","",,,,"Observation.component.dataAbsentReason",0,1,"ele-1
