<blockquote class="stu-note">
<p><b>Note for balloters</b></p>
<p>An anticipated future change that has not yet been incorporated in the value sets in this ballot version of the specification is incorporation of the SNOMED CT "free set" of concepts for the HL7 International Patient Summary, which will be released by SNOMED International on September 1, 2019 as part of the <a no-external="true" href="http://www.snomed.org/snomed-international/learn-more/global-patient-set">Global Patient Set</a>.  We welcome ballot comments on how this "free set" of SNOMED CT concepts (and any subsets of it) should be incorporated into the published version of the International Patient Summary Implementation Guide specification.
