  "introduction" : "An International Patient Summary (IPS) document is an electronic health record extract containing essential healthcare information about a subject of care. It is specifically aimed at supporting the use case scenario for ‘unplanned, cross border care’, but it is not limited to it. It is intended to be international, i.e., to provide generic solutions for global application beyond a particular region or country."
