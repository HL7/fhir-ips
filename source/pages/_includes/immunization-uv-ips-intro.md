This profile describes the event of a patient being administered a vaccination or a record of a vaccination as reported by a patient, a clinician or another party.

Two extensions are optionally used by this profile:
* the first one provides the details about the assertion (e.g. who did the assertion, when was done);
* the second one provides the list of diseases targeted by this vaccine.

The vaccinationProtocol has been removed by this version of the profile as pre-adoption of the R4.
