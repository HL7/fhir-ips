# Laboratory 

This observation may represent the result of a simple laboratory test such as hematocrite or it may group the set of results produced by a multi-test study or panel such as a complete blood count, a dynamic function test, a urine specimen study. In the latter case, the observation carries the overall conclusion of the study and references the atomic results of the study as "has-member" child observations
